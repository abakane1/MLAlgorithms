Feature selector is a tool for dimensionality reduction of machine learning datasets

Refer to the [Feature Selector Usage notebook](https://github.com/WillKoehrsen/feature-selector/blob/master/Feature%20Selector%20Usage.ipynb) for how to use

The feature selector is a tool for removing features for a dataset intended
for machine learning. There are five methods used to identify features to remove:

1. Missing Values
2. Single Unique Values
3. Collinear Features
4. Zero Importance Features
5. Low Importance Features 

The `FeatureSelector` also includes a number of visualization methods to inspect 
characteristics of a dataset.
